# Issues in working with the NSSO R files

This file follows from the README.md associated with this repository. 
I highlight some issues to be kept in mind while using the R codes and the NSSO unit-level data.
The issues pertain to the mismatch between the values I report and those available in the official report released by the NSSO. 
Since I am not sure of the reasons why these mismatches occur, I am listing them here. 

### 1. Differences in the number of sample households
The NSSO report gives the total number of rural households surveyed by them as 58,035 in Visit 1 (table 3). 
The number of agricultural households sampled is 44,770 for both visits combined (table 23A). 
However, the household-level datasets (levels 1, 3, and the combined datasets) give these numbers are 58,040 and 44,775. 
I was unable to find why there were five extra households in the datasets. 

### 2. Differences in the average (mean) income
The report gives the average monthly income of agricultural households as Rs 10,218 (table 23A).
But I got the figure as Rs 10233.94. There were differences in other component incomes - significantly in crop incomes. 
The difference could be due to the extra households. But I am not sure about this. 

There could be other issues too. Please let me know if you find any more.
